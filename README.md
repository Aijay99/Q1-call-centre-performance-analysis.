**RECOMMENDATION**

Based on the analysis, I recommend:

**1.	Reduce Answer Time:** The average answer time of 67.52 seconds is high and likely contributes to the 18.92% call abandonment rate. Strategies to reduce this to under 30 seconds should be implemented such as; 
-	optimizing work force at peak periods, 
-	deploying AI-powered call routing to match inquires with the most qualified available agent, 
-	develop specialised quick-response protocol for common inquiries, 
-	create competitive incentives for agents who maintain low response times,
-	implement chat support for simple issues requiring quick responses.
   
**2.	Improve First-Call Resolution:** With only 72.92% of calls being resolved, common unresolved issues should be investigated and strategies such improving staff knowledge via training should be implemented.
 	 
**3.	Agent Training Program:** 
- Implement knowledge sharing from top performers (Martha and Dan)
- Focus on improving Joe's customer satisfaction (lowest at 3.33)
- Address Jim's resolution rate performance.
  
**4.	Call Volume Management:** January shows significantly higher call volumes. Consider staffing adjustments or investigating reasons for this seasonal spike.

**5.	Implement Customer Experience Improvements:** The overall satisfaction score of 3.40/5.00 leaves substantial room for improvement. Consider targeted improvements based on call topic analysis.

**6.	Set Performance Targets:** Establish clear KPI targets for answer times, resolution rates, and customer satisfaction scores to drive continuous improvement.
